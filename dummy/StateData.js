The difference between a sprain and strain is that a sprain injures the bands of tissue that connect two bones together, while a strain involves an injury to a muscle or to the band of tissue that attaches a muscle to a bone. Pain and swelling that result from a sprained ligament usually last for a few fays, and most sprains heal in four to six weeks. The acronym RICE can be used to remember the recommended treatement for a mild sprain: Rest; try not to move the impacted ligament. Ice; apply ice packs immediately after a sprain to reduce swelling. Leave ice packs on for 20-30 minutes at a time, up to four times per day. Compression; use wrap-around elastic bandages to help stabilize the joint and reduce pain and swelling. Elevation; elevate the ankle above the level of the heart for 48 hours after a sprain. If symptoms persist seek advice from a healthcare professional.',
